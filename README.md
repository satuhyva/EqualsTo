# EqualsTo

With this small app one can perform simple calculations involving +, -, * and / operations. 
An important feature is that parenthesis can be used and the formula is shown to the user.

This app is my very first React Native app.
My aim in developing this app was ONLY to get to know a little bit about React Native.
